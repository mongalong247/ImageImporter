"""
Centralized, persistent path resolution for the app.

This is the single source of truth for "where is this app installed on disk".
Every other module (exiftool_manager, metadata_panel, app) should import
BASE_DIR / RESOURCES_DIR from here instead of computing its own path from
__file__.

Why this matters:
When PyInstaller freezes the app into a single .exe, __file__ inside a
bundled module resolves to a path inside sys._MEIPASS -- a TEMPORARY folder
that gets extracted fresh on every launch and deleted afterwards. That's
fine for read-only assets bundled *into* the exe (icons, etc.), but it is
the wrong place to look for anything meant to persist between runs (the
downloaded ExifTool binary, saved lens presets, settings). For those, we
want the folder the .exe itself lives in, which is stable across runs.
