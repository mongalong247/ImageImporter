# ImageImporter
 A lightweight image import utility built with Python and PyQt6, designed for photographers working with SD cards and digital cameras. This is a cross-platform tool aimed at making image ingesting cleaner, faster, and metadata-aware from day one.

### üß© Problem Statement

As a working photographer using vintage glass and manual lenses, my images lack embedded metadata for lens make, model, focal length, and aperture. Existing solutions treat metadata tagging as an afterthought ‚Äî clunky add-ons to existing workflows, not built into the import process.

I need a tool where **metadata management is a core part of ingest**, not an extra step later. This includes custom lens profiles, selective tagging, and backup-aware import ‚Äî with an emphasis on **workflow reliability and business resilience** from day one.

## ‚úÖ Current Features

- Detect and select source folder (camera/SD card).
- Select destination folder(s), including an optional backup location.
- Choose how images are organized: by import date or by shot date (file mtime).
- Progress bar shows import status with live count and percentage.
- Screening question for whether custom metadata will be applied ‚Äî logic stub in place.

## üß† Coming Soon

- Right-hand metadata panel that appears if "Yes" is selected for metadata tagging.
  - Global lens presets (Make, Model, Serial).
  - Checkbox-controlled fields for focal length, aperture, and notes.
- EXIFTool integration via subprocess, with user-defined presets.
- Persistent config files (to store preferred folders, lens data, etc.).
- Log file for each import session.
- Dry run option / import preview before committing.
- Drag-and-drop support (stretch goal).
